# Valtech Consultant Booking System
As a capstone project for SIT Learning, our team worked on a challenge provided by Valtech Switzerland.  The system allows project managers to easily view and assign consultants to projects
based on their skills and availability. Previously, Valtech had two separate systems for booking consultants, but our system combines these into one shared timeline that automatically adjusts to changes
in project deadlines and consultant availability. This new system simplifies the process of assigning consultants to projects at Valtech.

## Features
* **Combines previously separate systems for booking consultants into one shared timeframe**
  * The shared timeframe shows the availability of all consultants at a glance, making it easy to see who is available for a given project
  * The shared timeframe automatically adjusts to changes in project deadlines and consultant availability, ensuring that assignments remain accurate and efficient
* **Allows project managers to easily see which consultants have the necessary competencies for a project and are available during the project's scheduled time frame**
  * Project managers can search for consultants by competency, allowing them to quickly find the right people for their projects
  * The shared timeframe makes it easy to see which consultants are available during the project's scheduled time frame, allowing project managers to make informed decisions about who to assign to a project
* **Allows for the easy assignment of consultants to projects**
  * Once a project manager has identified the right consultants for a project, they can easily assign them to the project with a few clicks
  * The shared timeframe is automatically updated with the new assignments, ensuring that the assignment of consultants remains accurate and efficient
* **Dynamic capabilities ensure that any changes to project deadlines or consultant availability are automatically reflected in the shared timeframe**
  * This ensures that the assignment of consultants remains accurate and efficient, even in the face of changes to project deadlines or consultant availability.
